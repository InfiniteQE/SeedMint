The "original" **SeedMint** was tinkered without any references or drawings at all, quite a while back. 
But only recently somebody asked me, if i would make plans for such a Jig available,   so I thought if only one person would get value from this, it would have been worth while making those plans. This has also been the first time I have heared about [Blockmit](https://blockmit.com/english/guides/diy/make-cold-wallet-washers/ "blockmit.com") - quite ignorant as I'll admit..
Blockmit's a remarkably comparable design and I probably wouldn't have made the SeedMint if I had known about it.. :-)
The Jig is intended to be used with 2mm letter- and 4mm number punches on an M6 stainless steel washer with an outer diameter of 18mm.
You can get stainless steel canisters fitting for 24 of those washers on ebay for about 5 bucks or just use a screw and a nut.

Any contribution and/or feedback is greatly appreciated.

In the [CAD](https://github.com/SeedMint/SeedMint/tree/main/CAD "Drawings and 3D Model") folder you find the complete design in different format types .zip for Inventor 2019 and .f3z for [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.de/campaigns/education/fusion360?mktvar002=4246579%7CSEM%7C12339725657%7C117784167597%7Ckwd-11029869505&ef_id=CjwKCAjwzruGBhBAEiwAUqMR8F1lLQ7PN6ptK6VqJjig1oEHAGsIIn2FKxDVv-UDTMjYKzx_C850uhoC4mkQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!11172!3!517613592372!e!!g!!fusion%20360!12339725657!117784167597&gclid=CjwKCAjwzruGBhBAEiwAUqMR8F1lLQ7PN6ptK6VqJjig1oEHAGsIIn2FKxDVv-UDTMjYKzx_C850uhoC4mkQAvD_BwE "Autodesk Fusion 360") (which doesnt cost anything for personal use)

I'll add [PDF](https://github.com/SeedMint/SeedMint/tree/main/PDF) drwaings of the single pieces and a part list anyway
